## 🎯 Overview

### The Problem

In industrial manufacturing and maintenance environments, **visual inspection of equipment and components is critical but challenging**. Quality control engineers and safety officers spend countless hours manually examining machinery parts, PCBs, welds, and mechanical assemblies to identify defects, wear patterns, and safety hazards. This process is:

- ⏰ **Time-Consuming:** Manual inspection of hundreds of components daily
- 👁️ **Inconsistent:** Human fatigue leads to missed defects
- 📋 **Poorly Documented:** Handwritten notes and informal reports
- 💰 **Costly:** Defects caught late in production cause expensive rework
- ⚠️ **Safety-Critical:** Missed cracks or corrosion can lead to equipment failure

Traditional computer vision systems require extensive training data, complex setup, and lack the flexibility to analyze diverse industrial components with natural language interaction.

### The Solution

**DiagnostiQ** is a vision-based quality control assistant that transforms how industrial teams inspect and diagnose equipment. By leveraging **Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs)** via the **Qubrid AI platform**, it enables operators to simply upload a photo and ask questions in plain English—receiving instant, detailed technical analysis.

Unlike generic AI tools, DiagnostiQ is **calibrated specifically for industrial environments**. It features intelligent guardrails to reject non-technical inputs (e.g., food, pets) while maintaining high sensitivity for valid industrial defects like micro-fractures in silicon dies or rust on pipe fittings.

### 🚀 Key Capabilities

- 🔍 **Defect Detection:** Identifies cracks, corrosion, thermal damage, and PCB faults with severity classification
- ⚠️ **Safety Auditing:** Flags OSHA/HSE hazards including exposed wiring, structural damage, and PPE requirements
- 📊 **Technical Analysis:** Extracts component specifications, material identification, and operational context
- 📄 **Automated Reporting:** Generates downloadable PDF maintenance reports with conversation history and metrics
- 💬 **Conversational Interface:** Natural language interaction—no specialized training required

## ✨ Features & Engineering

### 1. Intelligent Analysis Protocols

We implemented three distinct "Personas" that change the AI's behavior and output format:

- **General Analysis:** Acts as a Senior Engineer. Outputs specs, material ID, and function.
- **Defect Inspection:** Acts as a Forensic Analyst. Outputs a **Markdown QA Table** listing specific anomalies, severity scores (Critical/Major), and rejection criteria.
- **Safety Audit:** Acts as an HSE Officer. Outputs a **Hazard Matrix** identifying risks and required PPE.

### 2. Robust Session Management (SQLite)

- **Persistent History:** All chats, images, and metadata are stored in a local SQLite database (`diagnostiq.db`).
- **"Ghost" Handling:** Automatically cleans up empty "New Inspection" sessions to keep the history clean.
- **State Memory:** The app remembers which protocol (e.g., Defect Mode) was used for a specific chat, even after restarting.
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can **Rename** sessions for organization or **Delete** them to free up disk space (auto-deletes associated images).

### 3. Enterprise Guardrails

- **Domain Restriction:** The system uses a global system prompt to politely refuse non-industrial images (e.g., "This appears to be a food item...").
- **Macro-Photography Support:** Explicitly tuned to accept extreme close-ups of broken components (e.g., cracked silicon dies) that generic filters might flag as "abstract" or "unclear."

### 4. Real-Time Telemetry

Every interaction tracks and displays performance metrics to monitor API costs and speed:

- 🪙 **Token Usage:** (Prompt + Completion)
- ⏱️ **Latency:** (Time in seconds)
- ⚡ **Throughput:** (Tokens per second)

### 5. Professional UI/UX

- **Dual Theme Support:** Custom CSS variables for a "Precision Light" mode and a "Cyberpunk Dark" mode optimized for low-light factory floors.
- **PDF Engine:** A custom `fpdf` generator that sanitizes text (removing emojis) to create professional, printable PDF reports.
